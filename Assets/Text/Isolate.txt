An isolation valve is a valve in a fluid handling system that stops the flow of process media to a given location, usually for maintenance or safety purposes. They can also be used to provide flow logic (selecting one flow path versus another), and to connect external equipment to a system. A valve is classified as an isolation valve because of its intended function in a system, not because of the architecture of the valve itself. Therefore, many different types of valves can be classified as isolation valves. So, it Is clear that any valve that blocks the fluid is called block or isolating valves despite its construction.
