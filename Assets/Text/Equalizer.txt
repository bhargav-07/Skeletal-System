The Equalizing Valve automatically relieves increasing center cavity pressure to the higher pressure end of the valve, while preventing leakage to the lower pressure end. The internal spring gives a preferential connection to the designated upstream end of the valve. When system conditions result in the downstream pressure being higher than the upstream, the ball shifts so that the center cavity connects with the downstream end of the valve.
