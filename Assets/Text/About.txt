Manifolds are equipment which connects two or more valves of a hydraulic system.

A variety of block/isolate valves can be combined in a single body configuration. Each of these valves has a separate opening below in order to connect a pipe. The main body or valve chamber is common to all.

These manifolds commonly include ball, bleed, needle, and vent valves. Their use results in savings in terms of space and installation costs.
